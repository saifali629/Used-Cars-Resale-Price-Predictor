# Used Car Price Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project predicts the resale price of used cars using supervised machine learning models.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing
2. One-hot encoding of categorical features
3. Train-test split
4. Model training & evaluation
5. Best model selection based on RMSE
6. Model saving and predictions

## Evaluation Metrics
- MAE
- RMSE
- R² Score

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Note
Place the dataset file (used_car_dataset.xlsx) in the same directory as the Python script.

If running on Google Colab:
1. Upload the dataset file to Colab.
2. Ensure the filename matches exactly.
3. Run the script.
